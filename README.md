# A general idea of the location

I'm working on figuring out how to make it more precise (or occasionally any at all)
It might save a few eyes now though

# Instructions

After downloading and running the executable it will prompt you for coordinates; one value at a time

Standing coordinates are your location before the eye is thrown

Hover coordinates are the postion of the eye after it's been thrown

Hover coordinates are easiest to obtain by sprinting to the location of the hover and staring straight up at the eye

#**Before submitting any of the second set of coordinates(after the first standing and hover measurement) move about 200 meters roughly perpendicular to the last throw!**#
